Simple Tracker Examples
===============

In here you can find examples on how to use both simple-tracker on the client-side and AWS lambda functions on the server-side to process the tracking data.

Examples of all simple-tracker functions
-------------
If you're interested in seeing an example of all the simple-trackers in use, check out the included [all-functions.html](all-functions.html) file. You can see that same exact page live at [https://codeniko.github.io/simple-tracker/examples/all-functions.html](https://codeniko.github.io/simple-tracker/examples/all-functions.html)


Examples of AWS Lambda functions (server-side)
-------------
Checkout the AWS Lambda function examples in the [server-examples](server-examples) directory. These are fully functional examples that I'm using for my own websites. Of course, you can do the server side however you wish and are not restricted to using AWS lambda. Feel free to use these examples as is or as a reference point.
